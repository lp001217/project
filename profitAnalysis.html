        <p style="font-size: 50px;"><b>Profit Analysis</b></p>
        <p class="para">The profit model of the platform will gradually realize sustainable growth through diversified
            revenue sources, flexible
            fee structure and intelligent advertising system. The main sources of revenue include platform service
            revenue,
            merchandise sales revenue, advertising and promotion revenue, value added service revenue and event
            cooperation and
            sponsorship revenue. The following is a detailed analysis of the profit model:</p>
        <p style="font-size: 35px;"><b>1) Revenue Sources</b></p>
        <p style="font-size: 30px;"><b>1.1) Demand customization commission:</b></p>
        <p class="para">In the demand customization segment, the platform conducts one on one customization transactions
            between merchants and
            individual designers through the aggregation of merchants, and the platform will take 10%15% of the
            transaction amount
            as commission income. This model can not only provide more business opportunities for designers and
            merchants, but also
            bring stable commission income for the platform.
        </p>
        <p style="font-size: 30px;"><b>1.2) Merchandising Revenues</b></p>
        <p style="font-size: 28px;"><b>1.2.1) Bside merchandise corporation income:</b></p>
        <p class="para">Collaborate with museums, cultural and tourism bureaus and other cultural organizations to sell
            co-branded cultural and
            creative merchandise, and the platform takes a certain percentage of commission or share based on sales. For
            example,
            for cultural and creative products jointly launched by the platform and museums, the platform may take a
            percentage of
            the selling price of the goods according to the agreement.
            Cend merchandise commission:
            For individual artists, designers and merchants stationed on the platform, the platform takes a certain
            percentage of
            commission based on sales or transaction amount. As the scale of the platform expands, the platform will
            also introduce
            entry fees as a long term source of income. Initial merchants' entry fees can be appropriately favorable,
            and as the
            platform grows, the fees will be gradually increased.</p>
        <p style="font-size: 30px;"><b>1.3) Advertising and promotion revenue</b></p>
        <p style="font-size: 28px;"><b>1.3.1) Advertising Space Charges:</b></p>
        <p class="para">The Platform will provide several advertising spaces that Merchants can purchase to promote
            their goods or brands. The
            charging model will be set based on the exposure, location (home page, category page, detail page, etc.) and
            the number
            of clicks on the ad space. In the initial stage, the advertising cost will be relatively low, and with the
            growth of
            platform traffic, the advertising cost will gradually transition to the model of charging according to the
            amount of
            exposure (CPM) or the amount of clicks (CPC).</p>
        <p style="font-size: 28px;"><b>1.3.2) Specific modes of advertising costs:</b></p>
        <p class="para">Exposure charge (CPM): applicable to high traffic positions such as the home page, category
            page, brand zone, etc., and
            merchants pay a fee per 1,000 displays. For
            example, for advertisers who need to maximize brand exposure and increase awareness, they can apply the
            platform's home
            page, classified page, brand zone and other high traffic locations for advertisement placement, and pay a
            fee of $20 per
            thousand displays (thousand exposures).
            <br>
            Click Charge (CPC): applicable to search results page, recommended position
            and other advertisements, merchants only pay when users click on the advertisement.
            For example, if a merchant places an advertisement on the search result page of the
            platform, the merchant needs to pay the corresponding click fee when the user clicks
            on the advertisement. This fee is usually charged on a per click (CPC) basis, at $2 per
            click.
            <br>
            Conversion Charge (CPA): In the future, merchants can be charged according to the actual sales conversion,
            merchants pay
            a commission for the actual purchases brought by the ads. After a merchant places an advertisement, only
            when the user
            brought by the advertisement actually completes the purchase (such as placing an order in the platform mall)
            will he or
            she be charged for the conversion fee, which is charged at $50 per order. The Platform will calculate the
            fee based on
            the actual purchase or other conversion behavior (such as users filling out information, registering,
            downloading, etc.)
            brought about by the advertisement.
        </p>
        <p style="font-size: 28px;"><b>1.3.3) Initial Advertising Offers and Later Growth:</b></p>
        <p class="para">Initially, the Platform may offer discounts on advertising costs and free or low fees to attract
            Merchants to the
            Platform. With the increase of the platform's user volume and traffic (e.g., after the daily users exceed
            10,000), the
            advertising cost will be gradually increased according to the platform's traffic and exposure value.</p>
        <p style="font-size: 30px;"><b>1.4) Value added service income</b></p>
        <p style="font-size: 28px;"><b>1.4.1) Commodity shooting and design promotion services:</b></p>
        <p class="para">Provide professional merchandise shooting, video production and design promotion services to
            provide customized
            marketing support for the resident merchants and designers. Merchants can choose basic or advanced services
            according to
            their needs, and the platform will charge according to the content of the services. For example, merchants
            or artists
            are provided with value added services such as product photography, short product video production and
            social media
            promotion. These services will bring additional sources of income for the platform.</p>
        <p style="font-size: 30px;"><b>1.5) Revenue from event cooperation and sponsorship</b></p>
        <p class="para">With the gradual development of the platform's brand, brands and cultural organizations will be
            invited to
            sponsor
            design competitions and cultural and creative activities held by the platform for a certain sponsorship fee.
            Sponsors
            can gain extensive brand exposure through the platform's tournaments and establish links with the cultural
            industry.</p>

            <p class="para">The Echoroots platform's profit model demonstrates diversified and sustainable growth
                potential,
                leveraging multiple
                revenue streams, including demand customization commissions, merchandise sales shares, advertising and
                promotion,
                value-added services, and event sponsorships. According to projected data, total revenue grows
                significantly
                over three
                years (from 26 to 95 units), driven by the expansion of core business segments—particularly
                customization
                commissions
                and B2B/C2C sales shares. Advertising and value-added services also show strong growth in later years,
                reflecting
                increased platform traffic and brand value.
            </p>
            <p class="para">On the cost side, initial investments focus heavily on technology R&D and marketing. While
                operational and logistics
                expenses rise with scale, they grow at a slower pace than revenue, leading to a steady increase in net
                profit (from 4 to
                38 units). This indicates improving economies of scale and profitability.</p>
            <p class="para">The platform’s financial plan is well-structured, with a clear path to profitability. If
                executed effectively while
                adapting to market dynamics, it is poised for long-term, sustainable success.</p>
